## Bank Transfer

### Email me if you need my IBAN, BACS or ACH details.

The way [fiat currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money) works is broken at its core, and exposing bank account details
online may cause malicious Direct Debit transaction attempts and other similar attacks.

The current banking system is based on a broken mechanism: who needs to receive money from
me have to contact my bank declaring that i have authorized a payment
(no active confirmation/involvement required by me in many cases), and the whole security
of this system is based on the assumption that every player in the network will either
play nice or be blocked for abuse, with limited refund mechanisms available for the victims through expensive insurance schemes.

# Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies

Blockchain technology revolutionizes the way money works.
You own your money as long as you hold the private keys. No banks, no third party risks.
The only way to receive a valid transaction is to obtain a valid digital signature
from the sender, with such signaure being valid only for that specific transaction
(no signarue reuse possible), and only if the sender account owns enough money
to send that transaction (double-spending attacks are not possible).

If you believe, like i do, that cryptocurrencies represent a way better alternative to
the broken design of mainstream banking, here are my public addresses of the major
cryptocurrencies i can receive, including stablecoins linked to the price of traditional money.
